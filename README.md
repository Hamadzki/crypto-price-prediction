# crypto-price-prediction

## 🌟 Overview
This repository presents a time series analysis project for predicting cryptocurrency prices. The project explores multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Chainlink, Polygon, Theta Network, and XRP, using various machine learning techniques for time series forecasting. It also includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and comparison. This project includes a web application that allows users to predict cryptocurrency prices based on the trained models. Built using Streamlit, the app can be easily deployed and used by uploading relevant data.
